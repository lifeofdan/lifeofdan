### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel Newman. I am a fullstack developer who loves to work on anything and everything related to the web. I am currently a VueJs and Elixir dev in my work hours but I love playing with all kinds of things in my free time. You will see lots of little repos trying all kinds of things here, from Elixir and JavaScript to C# and Rust. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on on a Discord bot using Elixir, Phoenix and Ash Framework but I'm sure I'll be onto something different by next week. ðŸ˜„
